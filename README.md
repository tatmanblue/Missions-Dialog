# Missions-Dialog

Libraries for missions engine and dialog between player and NPCs.

## Projects 
Projects are exported from this project as unity assets and imported into consumer projects.  
[Mission Engine](https://github.com/tatmanblue/Missions-Dialog/tree/main/MDStudio/Assets/MissionEngine)

## Format/Platforms
Unity Game.   

## Assets
You must have the 3rd party assets installed prior to opening any of scenes.   In house assets are built by bulding and exporting the asset and are checked into the repo.
3rd party assets must be purchased from the vendor (links provided).  Most of the 3rd party assets are required to run the demo but not required to use the library.
